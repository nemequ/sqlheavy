#summary API reference manuals for different languages

The SQLHeavy API is documented using [http://live.gnome.org/Valadoc Valadoc]. Just install valadoc on your system and documentation will automatically be built in the docs/ directory.

In addition to the Vala documentation, A gtk-doc reference can be built using the Valadoc gtkdoc doclet, which is available in the Valadoc git repository. The gtkdoc doclet is still a work in progress, but the documentation should already be extremely useful for those wishing to use SQLHeavy from C.

You can also view the documentation online (generated from the latest development version):
