The SQLHeavy API is documented using [http://live.gnome.org/Valadoc Valadoc]. Just install valadoc on your system and documentation will automatically be built in the docs/ directory.

In addition to the Vala documentation, A gtk-doc reference can be built using the Valadoc gtkdoc doclet, which is available in the Valadoc git repository. The gtkdoc doclet is still a work in progress, but the documentation should already be extremely useful for those wishing to use SQLHeavy from C.
